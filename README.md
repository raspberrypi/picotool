## Building

You need to set PICO_SDK_PATH in the environment, or pass it to cmake
You need to install libusb-1.0.

Linux/Mac: use your favorite package tool

Windows: download from here https://libusb.info/

If you are on Windows, set LIBUSB_ROOT environment variable to the install directory

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

for Windows non MinGW/WSL:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
nmake
```
## Overview

Picotool is a tool for inspecting RP2040 binaries, and interacting with RP2040 devices when they are in BOOTSEL mode.

Note for full documentation see https://rptl.io/pico-get-started

```text
$ picotool help
PICOTOOL:
    Tool for interacting with a RP2040 device in BOOTSEL mode, or with a RP2040 binary

SYNOPSYS:
    picotool info [-b] [-p] [-d] [-l] [-a] [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>]
    picotool info [-b] [-p] [-d] [-l] [-a] <filename> [-t <type>]
    picotool load [-v] [-r] <filename> [-t <type>] [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>]
    picotool save [-p] [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>] <filename> [-t <type>]
    picotool save -a [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>] <filename> [-t <type>]
    picotool save -r <from> <to> [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>] <filename> [-t <type>]
    picotool verify [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>] <filename> [-t <type>] [-r <from> <to>]
    picotool reboot [-a] [-u] [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>]
    picotool help [<cmd>]

COMMANDS:
    info     Display information from the target device(s) or file.
             Without any arguments, this will display basic information for all connected RP2040 devices in
             BOOTSEL mode
    load     Load the program / memory range stored in a file onto the device.
    save     Save the program / memory stored in flash on the device to a file.
    verify   Check that the device contents match those in the file.
    reboot   Reboot the device
    help     Show general help or help for a specific command

Use "picotool help <cmd>" for more info
```

Note commands that aren't acting on files require an RP2040 device in BOOTSEL mode to be connected.

## info

So there is now _Binary Information_ support in the SDK which allows for easily storing compact information that `picotool`
can find (See Binary Info section below). The info command is for reading this information.

The information can be either read from one or more connected RP2040 devices in BOOTSEL mode, or from 
a file. This file can be an ELF, a UF2 or a BIN file.

```asciidoc
$ picotool help info
INFO:
    Display information from the target device(s) or file.
    Without any arguments, this will display basic information for all connected RP2040 devices in USB boot
    mode

SYNOPSYS:
    picotool info [-b] [-p] [-d] [-l] [-a] [--bus <bus>] [--address <addr>]
    picotool info [-b] [-p] [-d] [-l] [-a] <filename> [-t <type>]

OPTIONS:
    Information to display
        -b, --basic

        -l, --build
            Include build attributes
        -a, --all
            Include all information

TARGET SELECTION:
    To target one or more connected RP2040 device(s) in BOOTSEL mode (the default)
        --bus <bus>
            Filter devices by USB bus number
        --address <addr>
            Filter devices by USB device address

            Save all of flash memory
        -r, --range
            Save a range of memory; note that the range is expanded to 256 byte boundaries
        <from>
            The lower address bound in hex
        <to>
            The upper address bound in hex
    Source device selection

## Binary Information

Binary information is machine locatable and generally machine consumable. I say generally because anyone can
include any information, and we can tell it from ours, but it is up to them whether they make their data self describing.

Note that we will certainly add more binary info over time, but I'd like to get a minimum core set included
in most binaries from launch!!

### Basic Information

This information is really handy when you pick up a Pico and don't know what is on it!

Basic information includes

- program name
- program description
- program version string
- program build date
- program url
- program end address
- program features - this is a list built from individual strings in the binary, that can be displayed (e.g. we will have one for UART stdio and one for USB stdio) in the SDK
- build attributes - this is a similar list of strings, for things pertaining to the binary itself (e.g. Debug Build)

Note it is my intention that things like MicroPython would include features for parts of the language/libraries they include.

This might not be as a feature string per se, but could be another aggregating list (features/attributes are well known)
but we can add another piece of binary info to name a list attribute that aggregates strings with a particular tag, so you
could trivially add "MicroPython libraries:" etc to the `picotool` output without changing the tool itself. 

### Pins

This is certainly handy when you have an executable called 'hello_world.elf' but you forgot what board it is built for...

Static (fixed) pin assignments can be recorded in the binary in very compact form:

```text
$ picotool info --pins sprite_demo.elf
File sprite_demo.elf:

Fixed Pin Information
0-4:    Red 0-4
6-10:   Green 0-4
11-15:  Blue 0-4
16:     HSync
17:     VSync
18:     Display Enable
19:     Pixel Clock
20:     UART1 TX
21:     UART1 RX
```

### Including Binary information

Binary information is declared in the program by macros (vile warped macros); for the previous example:

```text
$ picotool info --pins sprite_demo.elf
File sprite_demo.elf:

Fixed Pin Information
0-4:    Red 0-4
6-10:   Green 0-4
11-15:  Blue 0-4
16:     HSync
17:     VSync
18:     Display Enable
19:     Pixel Clock
20:     UART1 TX
21:     UART1 RX
```

... there is one line in the `setup_default_uart` function:

```c
bi_decl_if_func_used(bi_2pins_with_func(PICO_DEFAULT_UART_RX_PIN, PICO_DEFAULT_UART_TX_PIN, GPIO_FUNC_UART));
```


The two pin numbers, and the function UART are stored, then decoded to their actual function names (UART1 TX etc) by picotool.
The `bi_decl_if_func_used` makes sure the binary information is only included if the containing function is called.

Equally, the video code contains a few lines like this:

```c
bi_decl_if_func_used(bi_pin_mask_with_name(0x1f << (PICO_SCANVIDEO_COLOR_PIN_BASE + PICO_SCANVIDEO_DPI_PIXEL_RSHIFT), "Red 0-4"));
```

### Details

Things are designed to waste as little space as possible, but you can turn everything off with preprocessor var `PICO_NO_BINARY_INFO=1`. Additionally
any SDK code that inserts binary info can be separately excluded by its own preprocesor var.

You need
```c
#include "pico/binary_info.h"
```

Basically you either use `bi_decl(bi_blah(...))` for unconditional inclusion of the binary info blah, or
`bi_decl_if_func_used(bi_blah(...))` for binary information that may be stripped if the enclosing function
is not included in the binary by the linker (think `--gc-sections`)

There are a bunch of bi_ macros in the headers

```c
#define bi_binary_end(end) ...
#define bi_program_name(name) ...
#define bi_program_description(description) ...
#define bi_program_version_string(version_string) ...
#define bi_program_build_date_string(date_string) ...
#define bi_program_url(url) ...
#define bi_program_feature(feature) ...
#define bi_program_build_attribute(attr) ...
#define bi_1pin_with_func(p0, func) ...
#define bi_2pins_with_func(p0, p1, func) ...
#define bi_3pins_with_func(p0, p1, p2, func) ...
#define bi_4pins_with_func(p0, p1, p2, p3, func) ...
#define bi_5pins_with_func(p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, func) ...
#define bi_pin_range_with_func(plo, phi, func) ...
#define bi_pin_mask_with_name(pmask, label) ...
#define bi_pin_mask_with_names(pmask, label) ...
#define bi_1pin_with_name(p0, name) ...
#define bi_2pins_with_names(p0, name0, p1, name1) ...
#define bi_3pins_with_names(p0, name0, p1, name1, p2, name2) ...
#define bi_4pins_with_names(p0, name0, p1, name1, p2, name2, p3, name3) ... 
```

which make use of underlying macros, e.g.
```c
#define bi_program_url(url) bi_string(BINARY_INFO_TAG_RASPBERRY_PI, BINARY_INFO_ID_RP_PROGRAM_URL, url)
```

NOTE: It is easy to forget to enclose these in `bi_decl` etc., so an effort has been made (at the expense of a lot of kittens)
to make the build fail with a _somewhat_ helpful error message if you do so.

For example, trying to compile

```c
bi_1pin_with_name(0, "Toaster activator");
```

gives

```
/home/graham/dev/mu/pico_sdk/src/common/pico_binary_info/include/pico/binary_info/code.h:17:55: error: '_error_bi_is_missing_enclosing_decl_261' undeclared here (not in a function)
17 | #define __bi_enclosure_check_lineno_var_name __CONCAT(_error_bi_is_missing_enclosing_decl_,__LINE__)
|                                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
... more macro call stack of doom
```

## Setting common fields from CMake

You can use 

```cmake
pico_set_program_name(foo "not foo") # as "foo" would be the default
pico_set_program_description(foo "this is a foo")
pico_set_program_version_string(foo "0.00001a")
pico_set_program_url(foo "www.plinth.com/foo")
```

Note all of these are passed as command line arguments to the compilation, so if you plan to use
quotes, newlines etc you may have better luck defining via bi_decl in the code.

## Additional binary information/picotool features

### SDK version

Should add this; git revision in general is hard since the user may not have the SDK checked out from git, so we'll have to stick
a version number in a header

### Block devices

MicroPython and CircuitPython, eventually the SDK and others may support one or more storage devices in flash. We already
have macros to define these although picotool doesn't do anything with them yet... but backup/restore/file copy and even fuse mount
in the future might be interesting.

I suggest we tag these now... 

This is what I have right now off the top of my head (at the time)
```c
#define bi_block_device(_tag, _name, _offset, _size, _extra, _flags)
```
with the data going into
```c
typedef struct __packed _binary_info_block_device {
        struct _binary_info_core core;
        bi_ptr_of(const char) name; // optional static name (independent of what is formatted)
        uint32_t offset;
        uint32_t size;
        bi_ptr_of(binary_info_t) extra; // additional info
        uint16_t flags;
} binary_info_block_device_t;
```
and
```c
enum {
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_READ = 1 << 0, // if not readable, then it is basically hidden, but tools may choose to avoid overwriting it
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_WRITE = 1 << 1,
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_REFORMAT = 1 << 2, // may be reformatted..

    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_UNKNOWN = 0 << 4, // unknown free to look
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_MBR = 1 << 4, // expect MBR
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_GPT = 2 << 4, // expect GPT
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_NONE = 3 << 4, // no partition table
};
```
### USB device descriptors

Seems like tagging these might be nice (we just need to store the pointer to it assuming - as is often the case -
the descriptor is just a linear chunk of memory) ... I assume there is a tool out there to prettyify such a thing if picotool dumps the descriptor
in binary.

### Issues

If you ctrl+c out of the middle of a long operation, then libusb seems to get a bit confused, which means we aren't able
to unlock our lockout of USB MSD writes (we have turned them off so the user doesn't step on their own toes). Simply running
`picotool info` again will unlock it properly the next time (or you can reboot the device).
