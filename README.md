## Building

You need to set PICO_SDK_PATH in the environment, or pass it to cmake with `-DPICO_SDK_PATH=/path/to/pico-sdk`. To use features such as signing or hashing, you will need to make sure the mbedtls submodule in the SDK is checked out - this can be done by running this from your SDK directory.

```console
git submodule update --init lib/mbedtls
```

You also need to install `libusb-1.0`.

### Linux / macOS

Use your favorite package tool to install dependencies. For example, on Ubuntu:

```console
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libusb-1.0-0-dev cmake
```

> If libusb-1.0-0-dev is not installed, picotool still builds, but it omits all options that deal with managing a pico via USB (load, save, erase, verify, reboot). Builds that do not include USB support can be recognized because these commands also do not appear in the help command. The build output message 'libUSB is not found - no USB support will be built' also appears in the build logs.

Then simply build like a normal CMake project:

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

On Linux you can add udev rules in order to run picotool without sudo:

```console
sudo cp udev/99-picotool.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
```

### Windows

##### For Windows without MinGW

Download libUSB from here https://libusb.info/

set LIBUSB_ROOT environment variable to the install directory.
```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" ..
nmake
```

##### For Windows with MinGW in WSL

Download libUSB from here https://libusb.info/

set LIBUSB_ROOT environment variable to the install directory.

```console
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

##### For Windows with MinGW in MSYS2:

No need to download libusb separately or set `LIBUSB_ROOT`.

```console
pacman -S $MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX-{toolchain,cmake,libusb}
mkdir build
cd build
MSYS2_ARG_CONV_EXCL=- cmake .. -G"MSYS Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MINGW_PREFIX
make
make install DESTDIR=/  # optional
```

## Usage by the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK

The Raspberry Pi Pico SDK ([pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk)) version 2.0.0 and above, uses `picotool` to do the ELF->UF2 conversion previously handled by the `elf2uf2` tool in the SDK. `picotool` is also used by the SDK for hashing and/or signing binaries.

Whilst the SDK can download picotool on its own per project, if you have multiple projects or build configurations, it is preferable to install a single copy of `picotool` locally.

This can be done most simply with `make install`, using `sudo` if required; the SDK will use this installed version by default.

> On some Linux systems, the `~/.local` prefix may be used for an install without `sudo`; from your build directory simply run
> ```console
> cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local ..
> make install
> ```
> This will only work if `~/.local` is included in your `PATH`

Alternatively you can install into any custom folder via:

```console
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$MY_INSTALL_DIR -DPICOTOOL_FLAT_INSTALL=1 ..
make install
```

In order for the SDK to find `picotool` in this custom folder, you  will usually need to set the `picotool_DIR` variable in your project. This can be achieved either by setting the `picotool_DIR` environment variable to `$MY_INSTALL_DIR/picotool`, by passing `-Dpicotool_DIR=$MY_INSTALL_DIR/picotool` to your SDK `cmake` command, or by adding

```CMake
set(picotool_DIR $MY_INSTALL_DIR/picotool)
```

to your CMakeLists.txt file.

## Overview

`picotool` is a tool for working with RP2040/RP2350 binaries, and interacting with RP2040/RP2350 devices when they are in BOOTSEL mode. (As of version 1.1 of `picotool` it is also possible to interact with devices that are not in BOOTSEL mode, but are using USB stdio support from the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK by using the `-f` argument of `picotool`).

Note for additional documentation see https://rptl.io/pico-get-started

## info

The is _Binary Information_ support in the SDK which allows for easily storing compact information that `picotool`
can find (See Binary Info section below). The info command is for reading this information.

The information can be either read from one or more connected devices in BOOTSEL mode, or from 
a file. This file can be an ELF, a UF2 or a BIN file.

```
$ picotool help info

$ picotool help load
LOAD:
    Load the program / memory range stored in a file onto the device.

SYNOPSIS:
    picotool load [--ignore-partitions] [--family <family_id>] [-p <partition>] [-n] [-N] [-u] [-v] [-x] <filename> [-t <type>] [-o
                <offset>] [device-selection]

OPTIONS:
    Post load actions
        --ignore-partitions
            When writing flash data, ignore the partition table and write to absolute space
        --family
            Specify the family ID of the file to load
        <family_id>
            family ID to use for load

## seal

`seal` allows you to sign and/or hash a binary to run on RP2350.

By default, it will just sign the binary, but this can be configured with the `--hash` and `--no-sign` arguments.

Your signing key must be for the _secp256k1_ curve, in PEM format. You can create a .PEM file with:

```bash
openssl ecparam -name secp256k1 -genkey -out private.pem
```

```text
$ picotool help seal

## encrypt

`encrypt` allows you to encrypt and sign a binary for use on the RP2350. By default, it will sign the encrypted binary, but that can be configured similarly to `picotool sign`.

The encrypted binary will have the following structure:

- First metadata block (5 words)
- IV (4 words)
- Encrypted Binary
- Padding to ensure the encrypted length is a multiple of 4 words
- Signature metadata block

The AES key must be provided as a .bin file of the 256 bit AES key to be used for encryption.

## partition

The `partition` commands allow you to interact with the partition tables on RP2350 devices, and also create them.

### info

```text
$ picotool help partition info
PARTITION INFO:
    Print the device's partition table.

SYNOPSIS:
    picotool partition info -m <family_id> [device-selection]

OPTIONS:
        -m <family_id> [device-selection]
```

```text
$ picotool partition info

Family ID 'rp2350-arm-s' can be downloaded in partition 0:
  00002000->00201000
```

### create

This command allows you to create partition tables, and additionally embed them into the block loop if ELF files (for example, for bootloaders).
By default, all partition tables are hashed, and you can also sign them.

```text
$ picotool help partition create
PARTITION CREATE:

```

## uf2

The `uf2` commands allow for creation of UF2s, and cam provide information when if a UF2 download has failed.

### convert

This command replaces the elf2uf2 functionality that was previously in the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK. It will attempt to auto-detect the family ID, but if this fails you can specify one manually with the `--family` argument.

```text
picotool help uf2 convert
UF2 CONVERT:
    Convert ELF/BIN to UF2.

SYNOPSIS:
    picotool uf2 convert [--quiet] [--verbose] <infile> [-t <type>] <outfile> [-t <type>] [-o <offset>] [--family <family_id>]
                [[--abs-block] [<abs_block_loc>]]

OPTIONS:
        --quiet
            Don't print any output
        --verbose
            Print verbose output
    File to load from

    UF2 Family options
        <family_id>
            family ID for UF2
    Errata RP2350-E10 Fix
        --abs-block
            Add an absolute block
        <abs_block_loc>
            absolute block location (default to 0x10ffff00)
```

### info

This command reads the information on a device about why a UF2 download has failed. It will only give information if the most recent download has failed.

```text
$ picotool help uf2 info
UF2 INFO:
    Print info about UF2 download.

SYNOPSIS:
    picotool uf2 info [device-selection]

OPTIONS:
    Target device selection
        --bus <bus>
            Filter devices by USB bus number
        --address <addr>
            Filter devices by USB device address
        --vid <vid>
            Filter by vendor id
        --pid <pid>
            Filter by product id
        --ser <ser>
            Filter by serial number
        -f, --force
            Force a device not in BOOTSEL mode but running compatible code to reset so the command can be executed. After executing the
            command (unless the command itself is a 'reboot') the device will be rebooted back to application mode
        -F, --force-no-reboot
            Force a device not in BOOTSEL mode but running compatible code to reset so the command can be executed. After executing the
            command (unless the command itself is a 'reboot') the device will be left connected and accessible to picotool, but without the
            RPI-RP2 drive mounted

```

## otp

The `otp` commands are for interacting with the RP2350 OTP Memory. They are not available on  RP2040 devices, as RP2040 has no OTP.

Note that the OTP Memory is One-Time-Programmable, which means that once a bit has been changed from 0 to 1, it cannot be changed back.
Therefore, caution should be used when using these commands, as they risk bricking your RP2350 device. For example, if you set SECURE_BOOT_ENABLE but don't set a boot key, and disable the PICOBOOT interface, then your device will be unusable.

For the `list`, `set`, `get` and `load` commands, you can define your own OTP layout in a JSON file and pass that in with the `-i` argument. These rows will be added to the default rows when parsing.

```text
$ picotool help otp
OTP:
    Commands related to the RP2350 OTP (One-Time-Programmable) Memory

SYNOPSIS:
    picotool otp list [-p] [-n] [-i <filename>] [<selector>..]
    picotool otp get [-c <copies>] [-r] [-e] [-n] [-i <filename>] [device-selection] [-z] [<selector>..]
    picotool otp set [-c <copies>] [-r] [-e] [-i <filename>] [-z] <selector> <value> [device-selection]
    picotool otp load [-r] [-e] [-s <row>] [-i <filename>] <filename> [-t <type>] [device-selection]
    picotool otp dump [-r] [-e] [device-selection]
    picotool otp permissions <filename> [-t <type>] [--led <pin>] [--hash] [--sign] [<key>] [-t <type>] [device-selection]
    picotool otp white-label -s <row> <filename> [-t <type>] [device-selection]

SUB COMMANDS:
    list          List matching known registers/fields
    get           Get the value of one or more OTP registers/fields (RP2350 only)
    set           Set the value of an OTP row/field (RP2350 only)
    load          Load the row range stored in a file into OTP and verify. Data is 2 bytes/row for ECC, 4 bytes/row for raw. (RP2350 only)
    dump          Dump entire OTP (RP2350 only)
    permissions   Set the OTP access permissions (RP2350 only)
    white-label   Set the white labelling values in OTP (RP2350 only)

```

### set/get

These commands will set/get specific rows of OTP. By default, they will write/read all redundant rows, but this can be overridden with the `-c` argument

### load

This command allows loading of a range of OTP rows onto the device. The source can be a binary file, or a JSON file such as the one output by `picotool sign`.
For example, if you wish to sign a binary and then test secure boot with it, you can run the following set of commands:
```text
$ picotool sign hello_world.elf hello_world.signed.elf private.pem otp.json
$ picotool load hello_world.signed.elf
$ picotool otp load otp.json
$ picotool reboot
```

### white-label

This command allows for OTP white-labelling, which sets the USB configuration used by the device in BOOTSEL mode.
This can be configured from a JSON file, an example of which is in [sample-wl.json](sample-wl.json).

```text
$ picotool help otp white-label
OTP WHITE-LABEL:
    Set the white labelling values in OTP

SYNOPSIS:
    picotool otp white-label -s <row> <filename> [-t <type>] [device-selection]

OPTIONS:
    File with white labelling values
        <filename>
            The file name
        -t <type>
            Specify file type (json) explicitly, ignoring file extension
    Target device selection
        --bus <bus>
            Filter devices by USB bus number
        --address <addr>
            Filter devices by USB device address
        --vid <vid>
            Filter by vendor id
        --pid <pid>
            Filter by product id
        --ser <ser>
            Filter by serial number
        -f, --force
            Force a device not in BOOTSEL mode but running compatible code to reset so the command can be executed. After executing the
            command (unless the command itself is a 'reboot') the device will be rebooted back to application mode
        -F, --force-no-reboot
            Force a device not in BOOTSEL mode but running compatible code to reset so the command can be executed. After executing the
            command (unless the command itself is a 'reboot') the device will be left connected and accessible to picotool, but without the
            RPI-RP2 drive mounted

### permissions

This command will run a binary on your device in order to set the OTP permissions, as these are not directly accessible from `picotool` on due to the default permissions settings required to fix  errata XXX on RP2350. 
Because it runs a binary, the binary needs to be sign it if secure boot is enabled. The binary will print what it is doing over uart, which
can be configured using the UART Configuration arguments. You can define your OTP permissions in a json file, an example of which
is in [sample-permissions.json](sample-permissions.json).

```text
$ picotool help otp permissions

SYNOPSIS:
    picotool otp permissions <filename> [-t <type>] [--led <pin>] [--hash] [--sign] [<key>] [-t <type>] [device-selection]

## Binary Information

Binary information is machine locatable and generally machine consumable. I say generally because anyone can
include any information, and we can tell it from ours, but it is up to them whether they make their data self describing.

Note that we will certainly add more binary info over time, but I'd like to get a minimum core set included
in most binaries from launch!!

### Basic Information

This information is really handy when you pick up a Pico and don't know what is on it!

Basic information includes

- program name
- program description
- program version string
- program build date
- program url
- program end address
- program features - this is a list built from individual strings in the binary, that can be displayed (e.g. we will have one for UART stdio and one for USB stdio) in the SDK
- build attributes - this is a similar list of strings, for things pertaining to the binary itself (e.g. Debug Build)

The binary information is self-describing/extensible, so programs can include information picotool is not aware of (e.g. MicroPython includes a list of in-built libraries)

### Pins

This is certainly handy when you have an executable called 'hello_world.elf' but you forgot what board it is built for...

Static (fixed) pin assignments can be recorded in the binary in very compact form:

```text
$ picotool info --pins sprite_demo.elf
File sprite_demo.elf:

Fixed Pin Information
0-4:    Red 0-4
6-10:   Green 0-4
11-15:  Blue 0-4
16:     HSync
17:     VSync
18:     Display Enable
19:     Pixel Clock
20:     UART1 TX
21:     UART1 RX
```

### Configuration

This is very handy if you want to be able to modify parameters in a binary, without having to recompile it.

```text
$ picotool config -s name Jane
name = "Billy"
setting name -> "Jane"
```

### Including Binary information

Binary information is declared in the program by macros (vile warped macros); for the pins example:

```text
$ picotool info --pins sprite_demo.elf
File sprite_demo.elf:

Fixed Pin Information
0-4:    Red 0-4
6-10:   Green 0-4
11-15:  Blue 0-4
16:     HSync
17:     VSync
18:     Display Enable
19:     Pixel Clock
20:     UART1 TX
21:     UART1 RX
```

... there is one line in the `setup_default_uart` function:

```c
bi_decl_if_func_used(bi_2pins_with_func(PICO_DEFAULT_UART_RX_PIN, PICO_DEFAULT_UART_TX_PIN, GPIO_FUNC_UART));
```


The two pin numbers, and the function UART are stored, then decoded to their actual function names (UART1 TX etc) by picotool.
The `bi_decl_if_func_used` makes sure the binary information is only included if the containing function is called.

Equally, the video code contains a few lines like this:

```c
bi_decl_if_func_used(bi_pin_mask_with_name(0x1f << (PICO_SCANVIDEO_COLOR_PIN_BASE + PICO_SCANVIDEO_DPI_PIXEL_RSHIFT), "Red 0-4"));
```

For the configuration example, you put the line

```c
bi_decl(bi_ptr_string(0x1111, 0x3333, name, "Billy", 128));
```

into your code, which will then create the name variable for you to subsequently print.
The parameters are the tag, the ID, variable name, default value, and maximum string length.

```c
printf("Name is %s\n", name);
```

### Details

Things are designed to waste as little space as possible, but you can turn everything off with preprocessor variable `PICO_NO_BINARY_INFO=1`. Additionally,
any SDK code that inserts binary info can be separately excluded by its own preprocessor variable.

You need
```c
#include "pico/binary_info.h"
```

Basically you either use `bi_decl(bi_blah(...))` for unconditional inclusion of the binary info blah, or
`bi_decl_if_func_used(bi_blah(...))` for binary information that may be stripped if the enclosing function
is not included in the binary by the linker (think `--gc-sections`)

There are a bunch of bi_ macros in the headers

```c
#define bi_binary_end(end) ...
#define bi_program_name(name) ...
#define bi_program_description(description) ...
#define bi_program_version_string(version_string) ...
#define bi_program_build_date_string(date_string) ...
#define bi_program_url(url) ...
#define bi_program_feature(feature) ...
#define bi_program_build_attribute(attr) ...
#define bi_1pin_with_func(p0, func) ...
#define bi_2pins_with_func(p0, p1, func) ...
#define bi_3pins_with_func(p0, p1, p2, func) ...
#define bi_4pins_with_func(p0, p1, p2, p3, func) ...
#define bi_5pins_with_func(p0, p1, p2, p3, p4, func) ...
#define bi_pin_range_with_func(plo, phi, func) ...
#define bi_pin_mask_with_name(pmask, label) ...
#define bi_pin_mask_with_names(pmask, label) ...
#define bi_1pin_with_name(p0, name) ...
#define bi_2pins_with_names(p0, name0, p1, name1) ...
#define bi_3pins_with_names(p0, name0, p1, name1, p2, name2) ...
#define bi_4pins_with_names(p0, name0, p1, name1, p2, name2, p3, name3) ... 
```

which make use of underlying macros, e.g.
```c
#define bi_program_url(url) bi_string(BINARY_INFO_TAG_RASPBERRY_PI, BINARY_INFO_ID_RP_PROGRAM_URL, url)
```

NOTE: It is easy to forget to enclose these in `bi_decl` etc., so an effort has been made (at the expense of a lot of kittens)
to make the build fail with a _somewhat_ helpful error message if you do so.

For example, trying to compile

```c
bi_1pin_with_name(0, "Toaster activator");
```

gives

```
/home/graham/dev/mu/pico_sdk/src/common/pico_binary_info/include/pico/binary_info/code.h:17:55: error: '_error_bi_is_missing_enclosing_decl_261' undeclared here (not in a function)
17 | #define __bi_enclosure_check_lineno_var_name __CONCAT(_error_bi_is_missing_enclosing_decl_,__LINE__)
|                                                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
... more macro call stack of doom
```

## Setting common fields from CMake

You can use 

```cmake
pico_set_program_name(foo "not foo") # as "foo" would be the default
pico_set_program_description(foo "this is a foo")
pico_set_program_version(foo "0.00001a")
pico_set_program_url(foo "www.plinth.com/foo")
```

Note all of these are passed as command line arguments to the compilation, so if you plan to use
quotes, newlines etc you may have better luck defining via bi_decl in the code.

## Additional binary information/picotool features

### Block devices

MicroPython and CircuitPython, eventually the SDK and others may support one or more storage devices in flash. We already
have macros to define these although picotool doesn't do anything with them yet... but backup/restore/file copy and even fuse mount
in the future might be interesting.

I suggest we tag these now... 

This is what I have right now off the top of my head (at the time)
```c
#define bi_block_device(_tag, _name, _offset, _size, _extra, _flags)
```
with the data going into
```c
typedef struct __packed _binary_info_block_device {
        struct _binary_info_core core;
        bi_ptr_of(const char) name; // optional static name (independent of what is formatted)
        uint32_t offset;
        uint32_t size;
        bi_ptr_of(binary_info_t) extra; // additional info
        uint16_t flags;
} binary_info_block_device_t;
```
and
```c
enum {
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_READ = 1 << 0, // if not readable, then it is basically hidden, but tools may choose to avoid overwriting it
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_WRITE = 1 << 1,
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_REFORMAT = 1 << 2, // may be reformatted..

    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_UNKNOWN = 0 << 4, // unknown free to look
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_MBR = 1 << 4, // expect MBR
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_GPT = 2 << 4, // expect GPT
    BINARY_INFO_BLOCK_DEV_FLAG_PT_NONE = 3 << 4, // no partition table
};
```

### Forced Reboots

Running commands with `-f/F` requires compatible code to be running on the device. The definition of compatible code for the
purposes of binaries compiled using the [pico-sdk](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) is code that
- Is still running -
If your code has returned then rebooting with `-f/F` will not work - instead you can set the compile definition `PICO_ENTER_USB_BOOT_ON_EXIT`
to reboot and be accessible to picotool once your code has finished execution, for example with
`target_compile_definitions(<yourTargetName> PRIVATE PICO_ENTER_USB_BOOT_ON_EXIT=1)`
- Uses stdio_usb -
If your binary calls `stdio_init_all()` and you have `pico_enable_stdio_usb(<yourTargetName> 1)` in your CMakeLists.txt file then you meet
this requirement (see the [hello_usb](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples/tree/master/hello_world/usb) example)

### Issues

If you ctrl+c out of the middle of a long operation, then libusb seems to get a bit confused, which means we aren't able
to unlock our lockout of USB MSD writes (we have turned them off so the user doesn't step on their own toes). Simply running
`picotool info` again will unlock it properly the next time (or you can reboot the device).
